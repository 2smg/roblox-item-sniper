# roblox-item-sniper
Attempts to buy limited items as quickly as possible, as soon as they go below set threshold price. Don't even bother with free proxies.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above /w `requests` module
- Roblox account with enough robux
- Proxies

# config.json
- `price_check_threads`: number of threads to use for checking limited prices
- `xsrf_refresh_interval`: number of seconds between each xsrf token refresh (the lower the better, 1-5 is enough)
- `targets`: list of `[asset_id, price_threshold]` values (the less targets, the better the performance)

```json
"targets": [
  [asset_id, price_threshold],
  [asset_id, price_threshold],
  [asset_id, price_threshold]
]
```
